In fact, illegal immigrants are not the cause of most high crime </span><span class="c6">rates (</span><span class="c6 c8">Ewing, Martinez, &amp; Rumbaut</span><span class="c6">)</span><span class="c7">. This fact about who is actually committing the crimes in the United States &nbsp;is important to discuss because in reality, the high rate of crime in the states is caused by legal citizens, people who are born in </span><span class="c6">America (Perez-Pena).</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Too many people think that illegal immigrants are the cause of high crime rates in California. This topic was brought up frequently by Republican Nominee, Donald Trump during the most recent e</span><span class="c6">lection cycle</span><span class="c7">. &nbsp;From listening to President Trump&rsquo;s campaign speeches, the public could easily begin to think that all illegal immigrants are committing crimes and bringing drugs into this country. Trump made reference to this many times during his campaign for president of the United </span><span class="c6">States (Perez-Pena)</span><span class="c2 c5">. The issues surrounding illegal immigration continues to be a controversy which often becomes a heated debate among our state&rsquo;s citizens. The problem with most of the arguments about illegal immigrants and crime rates is that those who argue about this topic falsely believe most of the crime committed in California is not the result of our boarders being to open and all of the people living in this state illegally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal immigration has been happening for thousands of years</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;globally (Inkpen)</span><span class="c7">. &nbsp;In the last few hundred years, immigration has not done bad things to our country one could argue our country was founded by illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants have been coming to America since the founding of our country. The people who illegally immigrated to the U.S. at that time, were British citizen who owed taxes, were criminals, or left the army without being legally discharged. In addition, politicians have been trying to stop or manage immigration since the late </span><span class="c6">1700&rsquo;s</span><span class="c7">. In fact, i</span><span class="c6 c8">n </span><span class="c6 c8">1790</span><span class="c6 c8">, Congress passed the Naturalization Act, which effectively limited immigration to persons of European and Caucasian descent (U.S. Immigration Legislation). &nbsp;Then, almost 100 years later, in </span><span class="c6 c8">1882</span><span class="c6 c8 c9">, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which made immigration from China illegal (Chinese Exclusion Act). So, when we consider the 2016 election and the words of now, President Donald Trump, it is not hard to believe that the majority of the public believes illegal immigrants are at the heart of our problem when it comes to high crime rates (Donald Trump&rsquo;s Immigration). Also, each time there is a large wave of immigrants coming to American, citizens in the U.S. began to become fearful of that immigrant group That is the start of cognitive dissonance, which is an assumption towards group of people, or people from a specific ethnicity group and the general public holds a belief that all the people from this group will commit crimes. This is exactly what is happening today in regards how the public views people from Hispanic descent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, we should recognize that the majority of people who immigrate to the United States of America, in particular California, just want a better life themselves and their families, they are not coming to commit crimes. When studying the issue of immigration and illegal immigration, it becomes clear that President Trump&rsquo;s statement that all illegal immigrants will be deported to their country of origin, is not only something that cannot be done due to the complexities of locating all the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. When determining who should be deported, the government should only deport illegal immigrants who have a criminal record. The majority of illegal immigrants are working and contributing to the economy. In fact, our economy would benefit, if we simply passed a policy to make all the undocumented immigrants legal (The Criminalization of Immigration). These immigrants are not causing a problem they are helping our economy grow. Because these citizens are contributing to the country in a positive way, they should be granted citizenship. If we deport all of our illegal immigrants, then it will have a devastating impact on our state&rsquo;s economy and national economy. According to the article, </span><span class="c6 c13 c8">The Economic Impacts of Removing Unauthorized Immigrant Workers</span><span class="c6 c9 c8">&nbsp;(2016), &ldquo;A policy of mass deportation would immediately reduce the nation&rsquo;s GDP by 1.4 percent , and ultimately by 2.6 percent and reduce cumulative GDP over 10 years by $4.7 trillion dollars&rdquo; (Edwards and Ortega). If the citizens of California, and the United States develop strong cognitive dissonance against immigrants, and the President decides to actually attempt to deport all of the &ldquo;unauthorized workers&rdquo; we would face a recession near to what happened during the Great Depression the in 1930s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, televisions shows such as &ldquo;Border Patrol&rdquo; sensationalize the issue of stereotyping illegal immigration by producing episodes that really only show illegal immigrants committing crimes, bringing drugs, and attempting to enter the U.S. illegally a lot of the time with their families </span><span class="c7 c8">(U.S. Border Patrol)</span><span class="c6 c8">. Shows like this are part of the cause of cognitive dissonance toward undocumented immigrants. The show&rsquo;s viewers develop an assumption that almost all immigrants are like the ones on the show--criminals. &nbsp;When in reality, most all illegal immigrants are not committing crimes (Ewing, Martinez, &amp; Rumbaut). They are working. Many illegal immigrants work in the fields picking the food Americans eat every day, which is a large part of the economy, which the immigrants who work these jobs help keep thriving. &nbsp;In the article, </span><span class="c6 c13 c12">How Big a Problem is Crime Committed by Immigrants?</span><span class="c6 c12">&nbsp;author Julia Dahl states: </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c6 c12">a</span><span class="c6 c9 c12">ccording to analysis of the 2010 census and the American Communities Survey done by the nonprofit, American Immigration Council, immigrants to the United States are significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be incarcerated. The authors found that 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c12">One can see that for every one immigrant committing a crime there are three natural born citizens committing crimes. The public should be more worried about their safety due to the criminal rates of citizens rather than illegal immigrants who actually are committing crimes at much lower rates than citizens in this country. In addition, illegal immigrants pay more money in taxes than citizens. &nbsp;For example,</span><span class="c6 c11">&nbsp;in a February 2016 report titled, </span><span class="c6 c11 c13">Undocumented Immigrants,</span><span class="c6 c9 c11">&nbsp;by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP): &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c17"><span class="c6 c9 c11">Undocumented immigrants contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $11.64 billion a year. Contributions range from almost $2.2 million in Montana with an estimated undocumented population of 4,000 to more than $3.1 billion in California, home to more than 3 million undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants nationwide pay on average an estimated 8 percent of their incomes in state and local taxes (this is their effective state and local tax rate). To put this in perspective, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay an average nationwide effective tax rate of just 5.4 percent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c9 c11">This means if all the illegal immigrants were deported, the state of California&rsquo;s revenue would drop by over $3 billion dollars. How can President Trump argue that we are being hurt by illegal immigrants when they help provide a significant amount of the tax base in many states, and in particular in California?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c9 c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, some people would argue that illegal immigration is costly and causes many states to strain their budgets. Some people would say one impact on the economy is in the reduction of wages, because illegal immigrants work for less money, everyone is paid less. Illegal immigrants do have more issues with law enforcement, which is also a financial burden. Lastly, many people believe immigrant families tend to be larger in numbers which causes the local schools to strain their resources. Due to these costs, there are those individuals in our society who do believe these facts alone support deporting all illegal citizens and/or immigrants who are not authorized to be in our country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, illegal immigrants are not our problem or an issue we should be focusing on in our political debates. Illegal immigrants are the backbone of our work force, especially in California&rsquo;s agriculture industry. The facts about illegal immigration as stated by our current President are simply not true and if his administration is allowed to deport every unauthorized person who lives in this country, especially in California, we will see an epic economic decline that we have not experienced since the 1930s</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;(Edwards and Ortega).</span><span class="c6 c11">&nbsp; President Trump should be working on legislation that legalizes all illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, and create a reasonable pathway for those who would like to immigrate to our great country. &nbsp;We need to make it simpler for people to become a part of our nation, rather than creating a situation in our society that builds on fear and assumptions, as we see today in the high levels of cognitive dissonance in our current popula</span><span class="c6 c9 c11">tion. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c9 c11"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c6 c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c10 c19"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2 c5">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Baragona, Steve. &quot;US Farmers Depend on Illegal Immigrants.&quot; </span><span class="c4">VOA</span><span class="c2">.
