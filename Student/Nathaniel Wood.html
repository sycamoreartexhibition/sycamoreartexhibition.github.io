Woman objectification is definitely one of those things. It might not look to bad, but it&#39;s more than likely because we&#39;ve gotten brainwashed into accepting that it&#39;s not to bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s about everywhere in America. In 2017, it&#39;s on the radio, at least every other song, and commercials. Stereotypically, it&#39;s rappers and Carl&#39;s Jr. that are guilty of objectifying but their not the only ones! I believe they are trying to push out the limit of acceptance even more. The limit is bad enough, but the companies don&#39;t think the digits in there bank acount are big enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put an end to this before it gets any more out of hand. These greedy companies don&#39;t care if there are more sick-minded people because of their own doing. It&#39;s easy to see that these people are very self-centered, but could we change that? I believe we can, and it starts in our youth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my next subtopic, and it is a topic that has been shot down plenty of times. This is an idea about dress code, and how even that is spreading an even deeper message. People most likely think this idea is to far, but I argue it is perfectly in order. Girls are taught that boys will always be watching them, and boys are taught that it&#39;s okay. Instead of having a really strict dress code for girls, I believe it would be better to teach boys (kids and teens) to not view girls that way. This could change so much for not only for culture, but for people and their/our future. Music and commercials could change for the better this time and kids could be raised with clean minds and have better attitudes and well, not be perverts. Two 8th grade girls talked about this and the second girl said &uml;The teachers are always saying how they want us to feel safe around school. How could I feel safe when the staff are always telling me my body is a distraction and everyone is always looking.&rdquo; Of course the staff didn&#39;t actually tell her those things about her body, but that&#39;s exactly what the output message of the strict dress code is saying! Like i said before, if we could change the dress code, it would change the seed of thought that girls will always be watched, and that it&#39;s okay. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next subtopic is about ads again, but very differently. The sickness in these ads have been going since the very early 1900&rsquo;s. According to BuzzFeed, Vinyl print ads have had their share of sexism, but not in the sexual theme that&#39;s going on now. For example, there was one for a pill that &ldquo;won&#39;t give your boyfriend a headache&rdquo; and another that says &ldquo;The harder the wife works the cuter she looks&rdquo;. A quote from from someone that reviewed the ads said &ldquo;[talking about the ads then and now] It didn&#39;t go away or get better, it morphed&rdquo; There&#39;s no way better way of putting it. In ads, Woman have only gone from objects to sexual objects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the big and last subtopic: Culture mindlessly accepting this! Very few people do anything about this, and those people are instantly categorized as an obnoxious feminist. Is there a reason that culture want to stop people that try and stop objectification? There is a very good reason to as I&rsquo;ve been trying to prove this entire essay. It even damages girl&rsquo;s self-esteem. According to the huffington post, 53% of 13 year old girls are self-conscious about their bodies, as 78% of females do at 17. Statistics show the reason of this is because of modern objectifying, or more specifically, because of modern music.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that culture would be so much more successful in being good people if we were willing to get out of our comfort zone to make a new comfort zone, or get rid of objectification and not be used to seeing it everyday if not promoting it. There are three ways this could turn out: 1)this could just keep morphing into different themes, 2) Culture will start to accept worse things and we turn into a more sick minded culture, or 3) We put an end to this before it gets any worse and people will have cleaner minds, better reputation, and people will be more happy. I hope culture picks the 3rd option, because no culture should fall to something like categorizing. We (culture) have beat this problem before with race, but Woman Objectification seems to be a lot more sneaky and quick. I hope that we beat this problem later on, because that is what we need in order to become</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Whole.</span></p></body></html>
