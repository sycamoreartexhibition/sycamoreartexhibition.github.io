Continuing use and extracting fossil fuels can lead to problems later in life. Fossil fuels aren&rsquo;t the only source of energy with different drawbacks.

Extracting and using fossil fuels are giving out gases to our atmosphere making it thicker thus creating the greenhouse effect. When light from the sun goes through the atmosphere, then hitting the surface and creating heat, the heat tries to exit through the atmosphere but the increased gas collected on the atmosphere makes it harder for the heat to exit, trapping in the atmosphere. This can result in global warming.

There&rsquo;s not a big chance that we will fall by that time but life is definitely going to be different no matter good or bad. Pollution is making greenhouse gases which as we said in the past that collects on the atmosphere trapping heat, scientists believe that this causes &nbsp;glaciers to melt and raise the sea level. (backed up by www.eia.gov)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We talked about how bad it is to use but what about getting the source itself. You can get fossil fuels many ways, but all of them have their risks and challenges. Fossil fuels are trapped in the earth, they comes in three forms coal ,oil, and gas. Theses are found close together, which makes it harder to extract them. For example coal is mined and gas is bad to breath and has a chance to combusting, gas all so gets in the way extracting oil. When you are sending a pipe down in the earth, gas can start a hell fire, &nbsp;which can&rsquo;t be put out with water.
