Now if that surprised you, then you would be surprised to learn that the military budget takes up 57% of the federal budget,that is 589.5 billion dollars overall (CNN), now obviously this is a problem to be very concerned about in our country.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c4">So every time a president has a chance to alter the budget in any ways, they never seem to lower the budget in the least bit, every time they either keep it the same or raise it higher, so really the military budget is only gonna go up until one of our presidents steps up and changes it (CNN/NationalPriorities.org). Even now our newly elected president Donald Trump is raising the military budget by ten percent,cutting even more &nbsp;money out of other important things like health care and education. But not only do we have a huge budget for our military, but we&rsquo;re spending that money on some things that don&rsquo;t even work, take the F-35 fighter jet for example, we&rsquo;ve been pouring so much tax money and our budget into this thing and it still loses countless dog fights to the F-16 a fighter jet created in the 70&acute;s (CNN).In fact I was doing some research and found that former president Eisenhower warned America of to much money going into the military budget in his resignation speech, so he foresaw what was going to happen before anyone else did. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;I personally feel that we don&#39;t need such a huge chunk of our overall budget going to the military, although I do think that it should take up the most percent, I don&rsquo;t think that it needs to take up a whole 57% of the budget though, I mean our military&acute;&#347; budget is already five times bigger than the country with the second largest military budget,China (CNN). We know that our military budget is well over China&rsquo;s and the next 14 countries combined, yet we still don&rsquo;t lower it and raise other things. It&rsquo;s infuriating that we have such a big problem, yet it has such a simple solution, all we need to do is cut the budget by at least 10%, then distribute that money where it is currently needed most. That would overall improve the wellbeing of America &nbsp;and improve the living qualities of this great country, even after we cut it we would still have a significantly larger military than any other country in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t believe that the military budget is too large, even with all the proof out there, then just think of all the other things that need funding, Education, Healthcare, Science, all</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">extremely important things in our country, but all getting 6% or less of the federal budget.&rdquo;If &nbsp; we took 40 billion dollars out of the federal budget, then put it all to ending world hunger, then in twenty years or less, so many people would be better off in life because they&rsquo;re getting the food they need to survive.&rdquo; (Nerdwallet), this statement shows what that kind of money can do, not only our country, but the whole world and all we need to do, is cut the military budget and put that money to things that matter most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I understand how having a strong military can be a good thing I get that, but we don&rsquo;t need it to be five times larger than China&rsquo;s who has the second largest in the world (CNN), I&rsquo;ve considered these things and found that there really is no super good reason why we should raise or keep the military budget the same or raise it, I feel that the only good conclusion is to just cut it by at least 50 billion, then split that between the things that need it most during that time period, like I said before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel that the military budget should be lowered and we need to make sure that we aren&rsquo;t spending our money on all these useless things like the F-35 attack plane, &nbsp;our newly elect president Donald Trump is pushing to raise the military budget by 10% (CNN), this is a problem that must be recognized by the citizens of America and dealt with. We need to be putting this money to much more important things like education, science, food and agriculture and many more. I hope this essay has opened your eyes to some of the big problems in our country.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c14 c1"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Work cited</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c15 c19">French, Bill. &quot;Military Spending in the United States.&quot; </span><span class="c2">National Priorities Project</span><span class="c3">.
