Children don&#39;t like to get put into a home where they don&#39;t know anybody. You won&#39;t have any &nbsp;family to talk to or anyone that you know. It&#39;s hard to communicate with people you don&#39;t know. When kids go into foster care they don&#39;t go into a long progress they go through a short one. I think we need to pay attention to this because we don&#39;t know what the kids are going through and what they are feeling. They lose so much family, friend, and favorite teachers. They &nbsp;lose 6 months of their education, it&#39;s takes a long time for their foster parent to find them a school. They have to go to a new school because if they get abused their old parent/guardian knows what school they go to, and the school won&#39;t know that they went into foster care. Some kids have to go to 12 schools per year because of the foster parent don&#39;t want to keep them, so they give up on them. It makes me sad to know that those kids are losing that much time in school. They stay delayed and aren&#39;t at the same level as their peers. I think that they deserve more education. They deserve to be on the level their peers are on.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They &nbsp;lose 6 months of their education, it&#39;s takes a long time for their foster parent to find a school for them.

The foster care system don&#39;t mean to hurt your family they just want to put your child into a safer place/home. You will have to try hard to get your kid/kids back. It will be easier to put a child in a home if they have their own hobby. When you put your child into a bad environment they will try to help you and put them into a safe place. Also what I think about this is that they should place them with a relative so that they feel comfortable. Also that they could talk to them and know who they are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reason why i&#39;m doing foster care is because, I would wonder what it&#39;s like in foster care and how they get treated. The research that i found is truthful because they do get abused in many different ways. I feel like we need to do something about these people who are abusing these young kids, and they are making the kids feel like they are nothing. This topic makes me feel sad in some ways a lot of ways. Some of these foster parents have these children in a bad condition. And don&#39;t really care for them they only care for the money. These kids don&#39;t deserve to be abused or to lose their education or moving from home to home. It hurts me to know that these kids aren&#39;t able to see their biological parents and not have any education. All children deserve to have an education. When they do leave the program they have nowhere to go and no help getting education. Most kids never get adopted. From the age 14-18 do not get adopted. I feel like all kids deserve a home and a family to live with and to love. My cousins were in foster care and were almost starved to death, they also go seperated from their big sister. Some of these kids do get separated from their siblings and do get starved to death.</span></p></body></html>
