They spend a lot of money on stuff they don&#39;t need when it could be spent in other places or used for different things like solving world hunger or sheltering people or even giving people better medical educations. Even though having a strong military is important, but having people not having food, no shelter or dying from medical mistakes is not a very hard decision because suffering people is more important than having a military that is triple what the next biggest spending military.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about ten years the us military has been working on a fighter plane that they thought would be good. The military has been spending billions on research and the plane isn&#39;t that good. It has taken up a lot of time and costed a lot, the F 35 has been in the works for ten years but still can&#39;t beat a fighter plane named the F 16b &nbsp; what was built in the 80&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The F35 isn&#39;t the price &nbsp;but it took a lot of time and money, for a F35 it would cost near 135 million to build (one).&rdquo; (0,CNN,2016) &nbsp;&ldquo;Even though having a strong military is important but having people that aren&#39;t suffering and have shelter is more important.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In 2012 there were many families struggling to put food on the table to feed their families, and the us could help them out by stopping world hunger and stop people from starving. &ldquo;It would take about 10-15 years and 33-60 billion a year to stop world hunger.&rdquo; (1,Nationalpriorities,2015) 33-6 billion is a lot but the us military spends 601 billion a year that would leave them with a 541 billion dollar spending budget which is a lot. The military doesn&#39;t need all the money they get too andd in 2017 the military is supposed to get even more. In 2014 400,000 people died from medical mistakes, and if the doctors and sergeants were trained better maybe less people would die from medical mistakes and they would have more training and better experience to get better jobs and do better work. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military has lots of different types of vehicles and they are expensive, the military spends near 90 billion a year on vehicles a year, most of the money was spent on aircrafts what was 40 billion was spent and &ldquo;ship building they spent 22 billion on ships and 17&rdquo; (1,Nationalpriorities,2015) billion on missile and 6.6 on others. Others include drones, c4 and mobile bombs.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0">The government, and &nbsp;military should think about where the money goes and how to spend money more effectively and spend it on stuff they really need. They should also think about others like how homeless people need shelter, people who are starving or even people who die of medical mistakes because all of this stuff could be stopped.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
