Being online to some people is being in another place, a place that&rsquo;s in their control, because when someone is online they can be surrounded by people exactly like them, and put themselves in specific groups so then no one is left out. Along with being in groups of people who are the same, that also means that there are people that are in groups that think the complete opposite of you.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c8">When people are online it&rsquo;s very easy to make assumptions on someone else&#39;s word, because they&rsquo;ve been introduced to a group of people who believe the same thing as that one person. Instead of hearing all the facts of something, most people will act on a small/single piece of information they&rsquo;re given; even if in the end the rumor or thread of information is proven false people will believe in what they originally heard or thought. This also makes it easier for people to believe information that could hurt them, solely because many people have seen or believe in the same thing; such as medical information, self diagnosis, politics, rumours, descriptions of open things, and people. </span><span class="c8">(McGillivray, Nick 2017)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people were to talk about the direct effect of the internet on our younger society, no one could really respond with a complete and full answer, but Amber case collected data and found a rather interesting occurrence that happens quite often. She calls the effect of new developments in technology an adaptation that humans are learning to make. The reason that the internet, social media, and over all technology is growing, advancing, and becoming more popular is because it was made for us, to help us evolve into a better species, and the fact that more and more people are using it means that we can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t stop, because now we are &ldquo;cyborg humans: and technology has become our external brain and we have learned to depend on it for our developing lives. (Case, Amber, 2010)</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0">But we can&rsquo;t forget that it also causes great things to happen to our personalities. For example, an introvert can become an extrovert when online, because they&rsquo;re now behind a digital/online mask, they could take the initiative and be drastically more open and talkative than in real life. This is because people have grown accustomed to technology, and it&rsquo;s reached a point where it&rsquo;s now easier to communicate online through that medium. If we find it easier to communicate through technology, then what other ways will we, as the human race, change physical interactions with people, by being more open online than in person are we losing connections between each other?(Turkle, Sherry, 2012)</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c8">For these people communication is the only way to find help, because they&rsquo;re too afraid to speak out and be bothersome. Nancy Lublin, the CEO of Crisis Text Line, said that before the Crisis Text Line was what it is now, she originally made it to be a social awareness project. But teens and kids found it to be an easier access to direct help. It&rsquo;s easier to text in the bathroom in privacy than to call, use your voice, and be heard by anyone. The texts they received showed what scientists couldn&rsquo;t put a practical number on. No one knows the true number of people who are abused, bullied, raped, and do self-harm, because there are always people who are afraid and hide it. In order for them to ask for help they have to wait for a chance, without a anyone who could hurt them around. The Crisis Text Line was their chance, some of the messages they received were from mild cases of bullying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to school today, the boys call me </span><span class="c8 c9">faggot</span><span class="c8">.&rdquo;, others a bit more worrying and needed direct and quick help, &ldquo;I used to </span><span class="c8 c9">cut</span><span class="c8">, and my parents found out so I stopped, but I just started an hour ago.&rdquo;, but the ones that are in the biggest need of help barely come in because of pure fear. But when they do they receive the most help they could get right away, in private, without danger, &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stop </span><span class="c8 c9">raping</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me he told me not to tell, it&rsquo;s my dad.&rdquo; This one communication path helped people know about these problems and what amount of people are really affected, data grew 11 times what is once was after the Crisis Text Line was made. (Lublin, Nancy, 2015)</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0">When online our psychological well being is affected, but only greatly impacts the younger generations. This is because the older peoples, in our societies, brains have already grown and fully developed. Whereas with younger people, their brains are currently in the process of growing, so they take in what&rsquo;s around them and are constantly affected by not only themselves, but everyone. Being online also can take a toll on our emotional paths. Yes it can provide a release which makes people happy, but if you&rsquo;re unlucky you can become the target for bullying, catfishing, stolen identities, and more. What makes things worse is that anything at anytime by anyone can be said, posted, texted, DMed, spread, and started, but you can&rsquo;t leave. Unlike real life you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the time to encounter these people, it can happen within any circumstances. (McGillivray, Nick 2017)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In order to find an answer to the statement, &ldquo;How social media and the internet affect the psychological part and well being of today&rsquo;s younger society.&rdquo; we need to look at ALL the information about EVERYTHING on the internet. But the truth is we can&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no way to find a solid answer, there are great strengths in the internet and social media that have, and are still helping millions of people, but the amount of unknown variables inside of it, and number of hate drama, hate, crimes, and overall damage equals if not defeats the strengths provided. People can make assumptions and conclusions on answers, or choose right and wrongs, but I can&rsquo;t, due to the even points from both sides and the amount of inconclusive evidence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c8">Case, Amber. &quot;We Are All Cyborgs Now.&quot; </span><span class="c8 c9">Amber Case: We Are All Cyborgs Now | TED Talk | TED.com</span><span class="c0">.
