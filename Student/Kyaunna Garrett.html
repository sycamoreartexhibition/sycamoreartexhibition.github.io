because Black Lives Matter is still going on today in life,even though it has got in bI wanted to research on Black Lives Matter because i think it&rsquo;s an important thing to know about.Other people that aren&#39;t black treat them different from other people and treat like their not meant to be alive.The other people that don&rsquo;t like the black people,they don&rsquo;t respect them,or they don&rsquo;t treat them how they want to be treated,some people just kill them for fun or for no no reason just because they&#39;re black.I really think this is an issue because why do they hate the black &nbsp;people so much,what did they do to us to make people want to do all this horrible stuff to the black people.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p

that quote means is all the Americans in America are only racist to all the blacks and no one else just their skin color,how they act and because their black.Black Lives also need to matter because,just because their skin color is black or because their race is African American,doesn&rsquo;t mean they&#39;re not equal to other people.What do the black people do for people to hate them so much?Why does it even matter why they&rsquo;re black.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">People protest just for the black people to help them get freedom.&rdquo;They march down the street calling for the deaths of white police officers&rdquo;.(breitbart.com)I think that some of the black people want freedom in life,they probably want nothing to stress over there head every second,they might want everything to be fair and have white and black and other races to all be the same and be equal,and there life is a big struggle.&rdquo;65% support the movement,including 41% who strongly support it,12% of blacks say that they oppose the movement,among whites,40% express support,while 28% say they oppose Black Lives Matter&rdquo;.(www.pewresearch.org)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;About 6 in 10 blacks only 59% believe that Black Lives Matter will ultimately be effective in bringing about racial equality&rdquo;.Some black people don&rsquo;t even care if people like other races talk about them or if they make fun of them and their race,they just ignore because they love who they are,and they don&rsquo;t care what other people think about them.But the people who do care what people say about their race hurt inside and wish they can just be as equal as they are even though they are equal they just don&rsquo;t treat them like their equal.I feel better,it&rsquo;s not like back then where they treated black people bad and treated the white people good and fairly.I also think black people deserve at least a good peaceful life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They are the last socially acceptable hate group in America&rdquo;(</span><span class="c3 c0"><a

think that the black people go through a lot,and they want the people to just change who they are.Some people when they get bullied,they want to sometimes hurt themselves or even kill themselves which i think is not okay because they&rsquo;re doing that stuff just because they&rsquo;re getting bullied.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Protesters who marched in the streets of America most staunchly racist cities,and towns were attacked by police dogs,their clothing was tattered by high pressure fire hoses,and their lives were taken by police officer&rsquo;

people don&rsquo;t like the black people white officers kill them just because they&rsquo;re protesting to say how they feel or to help them out on saying why it doesn&rsquo;t matter to be black,but officers don&rsquo;t care about the black people and hurt them just because of that&rdquo;According to a U.S. Department of Justice analysis,most murders are intraracial,and 93 percent of black victims were killed by blacks,between 1980 and 2008&rdquo;(</span><span class="c3 c0"><a class="c9"

think to myself that one day people will realize how much black lives matter also,and i also think that one day people will realize that why they hurt the black people or why they mistreated them or
