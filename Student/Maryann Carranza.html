Farm Workers have one of the most dangerous and risk taking jobs. Their jobs can cause them health problems, birth defects, and death. Farm workers provide the food you see at the grocery store, they do a lot to provide that food for us and they don&#39;t even get paid enough.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need to be aware that Farm workers are not safe while doing their jobs. The pesticides that are sprayed on the crops go on the workers which can cause rashes, headaches, blindness, cancer, coma,and death.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also those who are pregnant while working are in risk of their baby having birth defects, cancer, and even death. -(Afop.org) They risk that in order to provide food for their family and everyone else&#39;s. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another thing we need to be aware of is that farmworkers are in the sun all day and don&#39;t really take water breaks because that comes out of their pay and they need the money. - (Ufw.history.com) Being in the sun can cause heat strokes. Also being dehydrated is bad for </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Lastly people need to be aware that Farm workers get paid so little for what they do.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Farm workers need to be treated better, paid more, and have a safer environment where they work. They deserve these rights since they basically feed all of us and sometimes they don&#39;t have enough money to feed their own families. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Three female Farm workers had a baby with birth defects because of pesticides. &ldquo;One baby had no arms or legs. Another had a deformed jaw. The third had no nose and no visible sex organs and died soon after birth.&rdquo;- (Nfwm.org)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many Farm workers are being affected by pesticides without knowing. Since more than half of the Farm workers are from Mexico, many don&#39;t know english and the pesticide label warnings are in english. -(Ers.usda.gov)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The effect of heat exposure caused three women to die. All of the women were grape Farm workers.&rdquo; One died in Bakersfield, a second near Mcfarland, and a third in Delano.&rsquo; (Abc30.com)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some people don&#39;t know that Farm workers provide food for the whole U.S. Most of it come from here in the valley. They get paid from the boxes they filled that day and what they picked. &ldquo;Workers are paid 20 cents to fill one plastic clamshell box. That same box sells in the supermarket for about $3.00. The Farmers picking the fruit get about 6% of the price.&rdquo;(Newamericamedia.org) One Farm worker named Lucrecia Camacho said &ldquo; The fruit that brings the growers the most money is the strawberry crops, but they pay us a wage that barely allows us to live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farm owners make a lot of money and pay the workers who do everything, so little. Farm owners think that all these effects on the workers are not as important. They are wrong. Farm workers are important but they are not &nbsp;being treated as if they were important. Three people in the valley have died of heat exposure. Imagine how many more will die because of the extreme heat they work in and they don&#39;t really even have any water breaks. The reasonable conclusion I have reached is to allow workers to have more breaks and not have it come out of their pay. Also since most Farm workers come from mexico at least have the pesticide warnings in spanish too. Some things as little as having pesticide warnings in another language can go a long way. Another thing that can help Farm workers is for the growers to be more safer about spraying pesticides, that can save Farm workers from getting sick and save pregnant workers from risking their baby to having birth defects. Lastly paying farm workers the money they deserve, since they only get 6% out of the money the farm owners get. Farm owners can do all these things but sometimes choose not to because they only care about the profit they make. Somehow we need to get Farm owners to do all these things and we can if we try.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefor Farm workers need to be safer while doing their jobs and need to be payed more money. If you were a Farm worker you would agree to &nbsp;to these changes because Farm workers only know how it feels to be a worker in the fields. Imagine if you lost your baby because of the job you work at or imagine you where the family that lost their loved one because of heat exposure. Tragic right ? So let do what we can to help Farm Workers.</span></p><p class="c1 c4 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
