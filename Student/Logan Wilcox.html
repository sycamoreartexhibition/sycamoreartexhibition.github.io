One of those things is how people decide to identify as. More and more people are coming out as LGBTQ+ and so much hate is going towards them for doing so. Kids, Teens, and adults who are being discriminated by these people are encountering very serious effects.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When people feel they are a different gender than what they appear it isn&rsquo;t just in their head or a mental disorder, it commonly is biological. There are x and y chromosomes in which make us either more masculine ( the y chromosome) or more feminine ( the chromosome). Sometimes a male can be born with two x chromosomes and be more feminine than other people, at this point it is up to that person to decide if they want to be identified as a male or a female or anything other. The same thing can happen to a female with two y chromosomes.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Nothing good comes from discrimination, acts of hate tend to always make situations worse than they are. Discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community is leaving people very hurt, both physically and mentally, in turn they have gone from substance abuse to even suicide. The fact that they want to identify as what they truly believe they are does not change the fact that they are human. </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c3">Wilcox 2</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Youth suicide is a huge problem in 2017 as it is the second leading cause of death for people from the ages of 10-24 (Flatt, 2017), when you also discriminate against them it makes matters worse. The Jason Foundation has found in research that &nbsp;more teens and young adults die from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease all combined.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Although suicide is a big issue, substance abuse can also death and shouldn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. (Hunt, 2017) An article by Jerome Hunt has found that the LGBTQ+ community tends to drink, smoke, and do various other drugs much more than straight people do, this is said to be from all of the discrimination against them. With smoking, gay and trans people smoke up to 200 percent more than heterosexual people do. Twenty five percent of all gay and trans people abuse alcohol. Only five percent of the general population abuse alcohol, the effects of discrimination are a big thing and can ruin lives.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Some people have tried to justify the discrimination by using their religion and saying it&rsquo;s against it . States have been trying to fix this but keep ending up in weird situations with it. They could say that discrimination is a hate crime and is illegal, to oppose to this the discriminators have said that they have religious freedom and they cannot take that away from them. In an attempt to end the discrimination the ACLU made an article </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Wilcox 3</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">addressing the matter (ACLU, 2017), the article stated how people can&rsquo;t actually use this excuse to discriminate and it is still considered a hate crime.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In some instances schools are discrimination on the student who attend there. In one case from Adrian C. a 17 year old from Utah shared a story of a time he was discriminated by his vice principal, who is someone students should be able to trust, &ldquo;When I did wear heels last year, I had an incident with the vice principal&hellip;. He followed me all the way down the hall talking, and said &lsquo;you know what I&rsquo;m going to call you from now on? Dorothy? Do you know who Dorothy is?&rsquo; Because the heels were red. The tone of the entire experience was him trying to humiliate me in some way, and trying to get the people around me to turn on me looking at them hoping they&rsquo;ll join in.&rdquo; Other reports have been made where schools have excluded LGBTQ+ people from school events and even prom. Some instances had students not being allowed to wear clothing that supports LGBTQ+ rights (Dwedar, 2016).</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All the things that have been stated throughout this can be seen as people just not having the same opinion as others, discrimination wouldn&rsquo;t be as big of a problem if it was just that. Some people feel the need to take it to the next level. A man had reportedly gunned down a gay nightclub in Orlando (Ellls e.t all , &nbsp;2016). The case was horrible and even former president Barak Obama had something to say, &ldquo;We know enough to say this was an act of terror and hate&rdquo;. This is a prime example of someone taking discrimination to the extreme and why this is such a big issue. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have argued that people don&rsquo;t have to be a different sexual orientation and that you are what you were born as. This is invalid for three reasons. One, the biological factor stated previously, two, as humans we have free will and the right to be whatever we want, and three, it isn&rsquo;t anyone else&rsquo;s job to interfere with anyone&rsquo;s life. Controlling someone&rsquo;s life without them wanting to is pretty much slavery and that was abolished long ago.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Discrimination is a daily thing that happens around the world. Although people don&rsquo;t always notice, just making fun of someone for being who they truly believe they are can lead to substance abuse or even suicide. People need to understand the effects of discrimination and hopefully that can end it. </span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c3">Sources</span></p><p class="c9 c11 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">Green, Emma. &quot;Can States Protect LGBT Rights Without Compromising Religious Freedom?&quot; </span><span class="c10">The Atlantic</span><span class="c8">.
