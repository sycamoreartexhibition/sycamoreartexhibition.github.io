This is an important issue to know as it is currently an issue of the present day. Overpopulation affects many different issues such as the economy, world hunger, demand for clean water, and many more. All of those are closely linked to overpopulation and its impacts on the environment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; First, it is important to know that the richer countries consume more of earth&#39;s natural resources. For example, Americans only make up 5% of the world population, yet they use about 26% of the earth&#39;s natural resources (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cosmosmith.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328829000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsMuDcipKFGfBGA9pxZp9y4YYylg">www.cosmosmith.com</a></span><span class="c1">, by James Hopkins). If the rest of the world used this much, we would need the rough equivalent of 5 earths to sustain life. As the population of the world increases, so does the amount of resources &nbsp; needed to later sustain those births. There is, on average, a death every 11 seconds in the United States, but a birth every 8 seconds, on average (United States Census Bureau). For every birth, the world grows larger if even by very little. The world is always increasing in </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mitchell 2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">population. For example, the need for natural resources has tripled in the past 40 years (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.overpopulation.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328831000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAOTaMDiw0ZdNwVBboLOi6V8IF6w">www.overpopulation.org</a></span><span class="c1">). When people </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">screw up the environment, however, the negative effect backfires. Pollution is a massive </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">effect of the waste of people. In 2012, air pollution killed 7 million people worldwide; 1 out of 8 deaths is linked to pollution (New York Times, March 24, 2014, by Andrew Jacobs and Ian Johnson). In China, most rivers have turned colors such as red as a result of water pollution. By 2050, it is estimated that many (if not all) rivers in China will be useless (China Uncensored, February 4, 2015). Because of the vast number of human beings, half of the mangrove trees have been destroyed, and half of the world&#39;s wetlands have been destroyed in the past century alone (</span><span class="c3 c10"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.overpopulation.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328833000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoKVmRTmZe8-eAPYVbgdm3oVnvDw">www.overpopulation.org</a></span><span class="c1">). Only around 15% of the world&#39;s original forests remain (New York Times, December 3, 2016, by Hiroko Tabuchi). Global biodiversity has gone down 30% in just 40 years (Livescience, May 14, 2012). This is only what has happened in the past couple hundred years, with the population much smaller than it currently is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; With all of this information presented, think of what lies in the next few centuries, with the growing population on earth. With the presented information, it appears as though the many parts of nature/the environment are getting destroyed by overpopulation faster </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">than one may think. Right now the future of earth seems pretty bleak and miserable. Along with the past changes, many rates and estimates also show the rapid destruction of the environment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mitchell 3</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">It took thousands of years to reach 1 billion people on this earth, 123 years to double, and 47 to double that.

With the information already presented about the current amount of trees, it seems highly unlikely that the 2050 demand will be met. Urban areas are expected to triple in size by 2030 so that also makes it harder for the demand to be met (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.overpopoolation.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328840000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRTA1UowNjmQmPQxOhvm7tR5qU4A">www.overpopulation.org</a></span><span class="c3">). But considering that the countries with the highest fertility rates are also some of the poorest countries, they may not be able to afford wood so the 2050 demand could be met but barely (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.everythingconnects.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328840000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEWeQMOuVCPRB_9Hm_VRCRCsRVIg">www.everythingconnects.org</a></span><span class="c1">, Human Overpopulation). Overfishing has caused the amount of sea life to fall 3 times lower than would be safe (The Guardian, Overfishing Causing Global Catches to Fall 3 Times Faster Than Estimated, by Damian Carrington, January 19, 2016). If this keeps up, it will be very rare to be able to eat fish or other seafood. As for pollution, it is already horrible right now. Imagine what pollution will be like with a couple billion more people. Currently, about 9 out of 10 Chinese cities </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">have failed to meet the maximum as far as pollution goes (China Uncensored, February 4, 2015).

Think of this along with the other environmental changes presented.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; Many people may think the environment isn&rsquo;t meeting its demise as fast as it is being made out to be.

By then, based on current information, we will have likely hunted down and destroyed the homes of many animals, whom of which, would likely have a large percentage of them being extinct. By 2050, there will likely be even less food than there is today. Global biodiversity is already drastically lowering today. There is also the issue of water. The earth is roughly 70% water but freshwater is our main source of hydration. An estimated 0.3% of freshwater is currently usable because of you guessed it: water pollution (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ngwa.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328847000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmC1PNdEcx-7b8ZNNXDIdd3MWZwg">www.ngwa.com</a></span><span class="c3">, Information on Earth&rsquo;s Water by Kimberly Mullen, September 5, 2012). Again, imagine the future. For the issue of the rate of population growth, many think the rate is going down. As a matter of fact, it is going down it is currently increasing about 1.1% currently compared to the 1.3% in 2016 (</span><span class="c10 c3"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.worldometers.info&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1495816328848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC5hKZY0e6d8D1qUbAMFv9vIvxtw">www.worldometers.info</a></span><span class="c1">, About).

After that, the time now decreases drastically to reach another billion. Overall, the world is definitely being destroyed by overpopulation faster than one might think.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; In conclusion, people are most definitely destroying the environment and not much can be done. The birth rate is declining but not by much. The amount of currently usable freshwater is not enough to sustain the amount of people in the near future. Global biodiversity is rapidly going down. In return, us human beings are having it backfired on us. At this rate, very little could slow this down, let alone solve these many important issues. </span></p></body></html>
