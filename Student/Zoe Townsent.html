Do you remember the time when you couldn&rsquo;t sit at a table at school because you were not cool enough? This is what human exclusion is. Separating other human beings for some reason they can&rsquo;t control to feel superior or to try to solve a problem. This is the cause of many problems in the world. Is our society doomed like a tragic hero in a story? Is there reversal for our story?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human exclusion is in our nature. During the times when the human race was beginning, we lived in tribes. If another member in our group tribe didn&#39;t have the same way of thinking or was weaker, they were often killed, forced to do the worst jobs, or had little power in the group. The same goes for most social groups especially schools. Often people will point out another&rsquo;s weakness and excluded them from others bully them, force them to do certain things and make others fear them. Most people overlook the others being excluded as normal, everyday thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most social expectations are a result others being excluded. If weakness is seen in society you excluded for it. Why do we do this almost &nbsp;every single day? A part of the reason why expectations is passed down through the generations. Like one of the many expectations women must wear make up. Mothers often will tell their daughters if they don&rsquo;t wear make up they will never be wanted in society. Therefore they will wear make up. These are the reasons why the smallest to the biggest things are influenced by these expectations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this ties into our pop culture. Most of these expectations are created by celebrities and richer people in society to make a flawless place to live. They do this by exclude those who are different, hoping the problems of abnormal will go away. If you don&rsquo;t think this is a problem then why do teenagers copy what they see in the media? They afraid that they will be excluded from their &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. The only problem is that you can&rsquo;t have a flawless place if people are separated by invisible walls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure most people outgrow this need to belong in a certain group and find their need to belong somewhere else. Those who don&rsquo;t are doomed to suffer many problems. Some are the short term effect such as feeling alone, left ou, lack of sleep and anger. Most of these are very fixable &nbsp;and are not that serious. However the long term effects can&rsquo;t be fix that easily, or not at all. Some are depression, severe anxiety, suicide, homicide, high school dropouts, poor mental health, and severe social problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there reversal for this tragedy? The best way to solve this problem just to stop separating everyone. Stop excluding people that are different race, gender, sexuality, mental ability, what they like, how they dress, where they came from etc. Putting up walls whether they be &nbsp;invisible or visible walls don&rsquo;t keep us safe, they keep us in our own prisons we made. Keeping us locked in our own prisons we made. Keeping us apart just causes more and more confit, war, suffering and closer to ending the world.</span></p></body></html>
