It is really surprising when you take a closer look at the numbers. Everybody should be aware of what is actually happening in their own country. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US police force is always armed with one or more weapons on duty while Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, and Britain are unarmed at most times on duty (qz.com Goldhill, Olivia 7/9/16). In 2016, 959 people were shot and killed in the US by police alone (killedbypolice.net). Compared to that only 63 police officers were shot and killed on duty in 2016 (odmp.org). That is a 896 person difference and it is easy to tell police being shot and killed is drastically less than people being shot by police. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers in the US are very far apart from each other. It is very evident that we need to make a change in order to benefit our numbers while still allowing police officer to carry guns on duty. Until the numbers go down it is proof that we are doing something wrong. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each state requires a different amount of training in the US but a similarity between all is that the amount police officers receive is not enough. North Carolina police officers are required 620 hours of training while a licensed barber is required 1528 hours, California police officers are required 664 hours then at least 14 weeks of field training while licensed Cosmetologists are required 1600 hours, and Florida police officers are required 770 hours while licensed Interior Designers are required 1760 hours of training (cnn.com Holly Yan 9/28/16). That was just the few that the website provided but the amounts seem completely unrealistic. Does that make you wonder how many hours go to safety and firearms?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iceland one of the unarmed police forces only has 20-25% of the police trained to handle a gun (washingtonpost.com rick Noack 7/8/16). If an officer was put in a big and bad enough situation it could be his life on the line. An officer&#39;s job is to protect and without the proper weapons he could be failing to do his job. All officers need to be prepared for possible obstacles that will come in their way.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example of unpreparation was a summer camp a few year ago in Norway. After the armed shooter arrived he shot and killed the officer on duty. The officer was unarmed and had no defense against a gun pointed at him. There was nobody trained or prepared enough to save the 60 people who died that summer. The police were unable to access the scene for an hour due to not being able to get the helicopter off the ground (Nytimes.com Michael Schwirts 7/25/11). You can only imagine that with better preparation this may have been different. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Slager, a 35 year old police officer at the time was on patrol when he saw 50 year old ,Walter Scott in a vehicle with a broken taillight. The only intentions Slager had was to pull Scott over and write him a warning ticket for the taillight. Scott then bolted to a vacant lot while Slager followed and was yelling &ldquo;Taser, taser, taser!&rdquo;. Slager then shot the taser three times before using it straight to Scott&#39;s skin. Scott somehow got hold of the taser and started coming at Slager. Slager claims he reacted from &ldquo;total fear&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;At that point I pulled my firearm and pulled the trigger. I fired until the threat was stopped as I was trying to do&rdquo;. He then went to handcuff Scott who was laying on the ground and he states &ldquo;I didn&#39;t know if he tripped or fell. You always handcuff a suspect --- always&rdquo;. In this case the officer claimed his actions were because he was in total fear and didn&#39;t know what else to do(cbsnews.com Crimessides staff 11/29/16) . He did as he was trained and did not start the situation out with pulling his firearm. What can we do to help stop shootings from fear?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpreporation and not enough training are not the only factors. When put into a situation of total fear you will most likely not be making rational decisions. One source says &ldquo;Emotions constitute powerful and predictable drivers of decision making.&rdquo;, meaning emotions help to make our decisions (Scholar.harvard.edu Jennifer S Lerner, Ye Li, Piercarlo Valdesolo, Karim Kassam 6/16/14). Another source says:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Furthermore cognitive explanation suggests that fearful and anxious &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; individuals might have a problem with misinterpretation in that they are</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more likely to misinterpret neutral or ambiguous situations as threatening, </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thus contributing to the maintenance of fear and anxiety.&rdquo; (csun.edu </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Edward Binder) </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">That also meaning fear messes with your decision making. This can be dangerous while being a police officer because if you are making decisions while not in the right mind then you are also failing at your job.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may feel cops shouldn&#39;t be in fear of other people. What happens when you unarm police but still have citizens of the US walking the streets with guns? Not everybody will abuse their gun rights but there are some bad people out there with bad intentions who will. Is the real question who should be fearing who? </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guns are not capable of pointing themselves at a person and pulling the trigger. It is the person behind the gun who decides what happens. There will always be a couple numbers caused by bad people wanting to do bad things but for now we can try to bring the numbers down. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0 c10">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Binder, Edward. </span><span class="c0 c2">California State University, Northridge</span><span class="c0">.
