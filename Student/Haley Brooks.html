I fully understood child abuse after doing all my research on it . I think everyone needs to be aware of what might be happening to others. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c3">Sometimes child abuse happens because that adult might of been abused as a child. They probably wanted to show someone what it was like for them. How they felt like and how it scared them for life. But them going threw that could go either way. &nbsp;It could also prevent child abuse , because an adult might want their child to have a better life. That&#39;s not the only thing that could cause child abuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">There are other things such as parent characteristics. All the characteristics I am about to list were by ashish noel, date Jan 13, 2013. Some characteristics are violence, poverty, low self esteem, and drug abuse. Not just the parent characteristic but also the child&#39;s could cause abuse . For example child&#39;s temper, position in family, or also had a drug abuse problem. I believe that child abuse isn&#39;t just because of the parents , it&#39;s also because of the child&#39;s behavior.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">Child abuse is not okay but it&#39;s also not just one&#39;s fault.

Gabriel misses school for maybe more than a month. He just tells his teacher that we went on a trip, but his teacher notices marks on him.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">His lip was swollen and a big cut in the middle of his lip. Apparently his mom had punched him . A couple days later there was bruises on his face. He had told his teacher he was playing with his brother and fell. Later he finally told his teacher what really happened.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said that when he gets in trouble his mom makes him workout. While he works out she shoots him in the face with a bb gun. After that day Gabriel misses four &nbsp;more weeks of school . On May second his mother pearl calls nine one one and says gabriel&rsquo;s not breathing. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">His skull had several fractures and his two front teeth were knocked out. He had bb gun wounds that fractured his ribs. Gabriel had bruises and burns all over his body. Pearl and her boyfriend had beaten him up and shot him with the bb gun until he could hardly stay alive. On may twenty third, Gabriel Fernandez died in the hospital. He died at seven years old , they said he could not of been in that condition for no reason. So the cops got to analyze the body and also got a search warrant</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c4 c3">His mother and her boyfriend were both sent to jail under the murder of Gabriel Fernandez. I wonder what in the you know what was going thru their minds when they killed their own son.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most important part in my opinion on this. NO MORE CHILD ABUSE SHOULD HAPPEN. I mean recently one of my friend&rsquo;s and their sister had to make a child abuse report against their step dad. I am not going to name who , but it made me feel very bad for my friend when they had to talk to child services and tell them what happened.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My argument is partly a question.
