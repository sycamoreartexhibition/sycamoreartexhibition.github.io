In Greeley, Colorado, 20 year old Angie Zapata was beaten to death by her date, Allen Andrade, after he found out she was transgender (The Advocate, 2008). LGBTQ+ community face discrimination and hate everyday. 15.61% of physical violence reported in 2016 was for LGBTQ+(Rob Wile, 2016). With growing rates of hate crimes and laws allowing discrimination, the LGBTQ+ community are more fearful than ever.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0">In the beginning, members of the LGBTQ+ community were uncommon and thought to have a mental disorder: &ldquo;April 1952-The American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s diagnostic manual lists homosexuality as a sociopathic personality disturbance.&rdquo; (CNN Library 2017). Maryland was the first state to ban same sex marriage in 1973.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time went on more and more people &ldquo;came out of the closet&rdquo; and more awareness was being raised. In 1973, homosexuality was removed from the list of disorders. (CNN Library, 2017). &ldquo; The first federal gay rights bill is introduced to address discrimination based on sexual orientation.&rdquo; (CNN Library, 2017) Sadly this bill never got considered and potentially causing later problems for the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bill Clinton signs &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo;, in 1993: &ldquo; a military policy directive that prohibits openly gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the military, but also prohibits the harassment of &ldquo;closeted&rdquo; homosexuals.&rdquo; (CNN Library, 2017) This meaning if you have come out as homosexual/ gay you cannot serve in the military. If you haven&rsquo;t come out, you can serve in the military and are protected by the law to not be harassed. Hence the name don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more time passes the LGBTQ+ community is getting less and then more and then less rights. When Obama came into office it took a good turn for the community. Obama did more for the LGBTQ+ community than any president had done, but now with Trump and Pence in office their rights are being taken away:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mike Pence who has become the face of the anti-LGBTQ discrimination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after signing a bill to allow businesses to discriminate and deny services to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LGBTQ people because of whom they are and who they love. (Chad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griffin, 2016)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Services can mean even denying them jobs, and allowing discrimination in the workplace. &nbsp;4% of the US job force identifies as LGBTQ+ , but 1/25 complaints in the workplace are from LGBTQ+. (Kurina Baksh, 2016)&ldquo;...Trump has made it clear he would not enforce federal civil rights laws ensure transgender Americans are treated equally under the law&rdquo; &nbsp;(Chad Griffin, 2016) This results in having 90% of the transgender employees experiencing mistreatment in the workplace. (Kurina Baksh) When Mike Pence was governor of Indiana he signed the Religious Freedom Act, which would allow businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ+ customers: </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This order would allow for rampant discrimination- people thrown out of their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs and their homes, and denied service. It would allow government &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees to decline to interact with LGBT people, or anyone of whom they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disapprove, all in the name of &ldquo;religious liberty.&rdquo; (Michelangelo Signorile,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0">This leads into House Bill 2 that was recently signed in North Carolina, taking away the right of letting the transgender community use their bathroom and locker room with the gender they identify with.

This would allow state funded adoptions agencies to discriminate against potential parents as well. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another potential problem LGBTQ+ community will encounter is conversion or reparative therapy. &ldquo;Conversion therapy is a set of practices that intend to change a person&rsquo;s sexuality or gender identity to fit heterosexual or cisgender standards and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expectations- and usually it is religiously motivated.&rdquo; (James Nichols, 2016) Conversion therapy can have many negative short-term and long-term effects on children and adults. It has been proven by the nation&rsquo;s leading mental and medical professionals that it is &ldquo;...unnecessary, ineffective, and dangerous.&rdquo; (Lauren Gray, 2014) Some of the practices include hypnosis, behavior therapies, cognitive therapies, psychotropic medication, talk therapy, electroshock therapy, and or treating LGBTQ+ as if it was substance abuse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article by time magazine in 1965, it says, &ldquo;One reason why homosexuals are so rarely try treatment...too many of them believe they are happy and satisfies the way they are.&rdquo; ( Jonathan Merritt, 2015) This statement has been proven wrong, before the 70&rsquo;s being homosexual was a mental disorder. People thought treating it like one would help the person turn back to heterosexuality. Many people, such as parents, religious groups, and homophobes, think this &ldquo;conversion therapy&rdquo; can help turn themselves, or a person they know, heterosexual. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conservative Christian named Julie Rodgers, a &ldquo;survivor&rdquo; of conversion therapy, was told, &ldquo;if she continued praying, reading the Bible, attending meetings,and of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course, refusing to identify as gay, her sexual orientation would eventually change.. &ldquo; (Jonathan Merritt, 2015) Another &ldquo;survivor&rdquo; of conversion therapy, TC, (his name was kept anonymous) didn&rsquo;t have it as easy. He says in an interview with Huffington Post,&ldquo;The conversion therapy practices took place in the basement of a church after school hours,...&rdquo; (James Nichols, 2016) TC was 15 when he was forced into conversion therapy by his parents. He experienced harassment, aversion therapy, shock therapy, and physical abuse. He tells Huffington Post,&rdquo; Their goal was to get us to hate being LGBTQ+...&rdquo; (James Nichols, 2016) These practices have many long term negative effects. Some include anxiety, depression, drug use, an in worse cases, suicide. The effect on kids having to go through this at a young age is even worse. </span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In one highly publicized case from the early 1970s, psychologist George</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Rekers treated a five-year-old boy named Kirk Murphy, who had exhibited </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">stereotypically feminine behavior such as a preference for girls&rsquo; toys. Rekers</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">instructed Murphy&rsquo;s parents to reward him for exhibiting &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to punish him (by ignoring or even spanking him) when he displayed</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;feminine&rdquo; behavior.&rdquo; (Lauren Gray, 2014)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Murphy ended up having severe psychological problems and attempted suicide when he was 17, unfortunately he died at the age of 38 from suicide. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that are against giving equal rights to the LGBTQ+ community believe that it is not traditional marriage, and deprives a kid of a traditional mom and dad. Some think that if the child has homosexual parents that the kid will turn LGBTQ+, or that those kinds of &ldquo;behaviors&rdquo; are okay. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many children are deprived of a father or a mother with 43% of children growing up without a father (Mckinley Irvin, 2012). It has been scientifically proven by University of Colorado Denver and University of Oregon that &ldquo;... there&rsquo;s no differences in the outcomes of children&hellip;&rdquo; who grow up with same sex parents. (Katherine Foley, 2015) Also marriage was re-defined in September of 1996, &ldquo;President Bill Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act, banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage as &lsquo;a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife&rsquo;.&rdquo; (CNN Library, 2017) It has since been changed by the U.S. Supreme Court who, &ldquo;U</span><span class="c1">.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision that one-man one woman marriage laws violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.&rdquo; (Focus on the Family, 2015). N</span><span class="c0">ow the definition is &ldquo; 1. the legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship...&rdquo; (Merriam Webster, 2017)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0">With all things considered, the worth of a person should not be defined by who they are or who they love. We are all equal and deserve to be treated that way. The discrimination needs to stop. Our President and Vice President are negatively influencing our younger generation and it&rsquo;s not healthy for the country. LGBTQ+ should not be denied rights because of who they are and who they love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Baksh, Kurina. &quot;Workplace Discrimination: The LGBT Workforce.&quot; </span><span class="c1 c8">The Huffington Post</span><span class="c0">.
