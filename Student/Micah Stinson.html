He was selling meatballs at a county fair, but he found that people couldn&#39;t really eat while walking and talking. So, he smashed two meatballs together and placed the patty between two slices of bread. Little did that 15 year-old kid know that head just created something revolutionary to be known as the symbol - food of America.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s tragic how something that started out so innocent would soon be made into a weapon with a sole purpose of making us addicted, coming back for more, and spending all of our money. Many people in the United States are addicted to fast food and they don&rsquo;t even know it. Their own mind is trying to work against them and make them think that fast food tastes good. Things such as sodium sticks, also knowns as &ldquo;french fries&rdquo; along with ice-cold sodas can be more addictive than some intense drugs such as heroin and cocaine (Hyman - 2014). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman wrote an entire article on her blog about why she takes her kids to McDonalds. It was filled with false and biased information. An example is when she said, &ldquo;Sure the strawberry-banana smoothie has a lot of sugar in it, but so do smoothies everywhere else. &ldquo; (writer of streaminggourmet.com - 2012). Turns out, when compared to Jamba Juice&rsquo;s strawberry smoothie, it has more sugar, more fat, more carbs, more calories and less protein. In the article, she also says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal? It tastes great.&rdquo; I think that statement speaks for the average American and I don&rsquo;t blame her. None of this information is well-advertised or well-known. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man by the name of Don Gorske, a fast food enthusiast, has eaten over 29,000 Big Macs in his entire life and is still going; this we know from receipts. The thing is, he&rsquo;s completely fine. Some people are genetically built with bulletproof health statuses, but others aren&rsquo;t . Just the hamburger bun used in a Big Mac has three tablespoons of sugar in it. That should say something. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even I eat at a Mac Shack every once in awhile, but I shouldn&rsquo;t . I&rsquo;m not saying that you should never eat fast food and then I go eat it every day, but I just think we should take these facts into account when we choose what to eat. Not everyone will agree with me, but if I can get just a couple people to cut back a little bit, progress is being made. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan Spurlock produced a documentary film about his journey of solely eating McDonalds for one month straight. He begun the process in great health as an above-average American. By the first week, his doctors were telling him to stop and go back to his old life because there were too many risks. Even the doctors, at the beginning, said there wouldn&rsquo;t be any drastic changes, but they were wrong. The DOCTORS didn&rsquo;t even know the effects of fast food. The DOCTORS (Spurlock-2004)!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, moving to the subject of pay. The average worker&rsquo;s wage at McDonald&rsquo;s earns about $8.50/ hour. If they are working a 40-hour/week, that&rsquo;s $340. If we say that they work all year that would average about $7,700. If you subtract taxes, that&rsquo;s about $15,900 left. The apartments can range from $500 - $2,000/month, costing somewhere around $15,000/year. That only leaves you with $900 for clothes, food, and don&rsquo;t even think about college. McDonald&rsquo;s is literally making their workers poor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a map of counties in the U.S. and the poverty levels of each. There is higher poverty on the coasts and more back east, but less in the midwestern areas. There is also a map of all the McDonald&rsquo;s in America, and it looks the same as the other one; there is more on the coasts and less in the midwestern region...do the math (Lee- 2013). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not saying that we should boycott fast food completely, but I hope that this makes you think. I think that if we can decrease our consumption of fast food we will have a healthier America. This would be beneficial for everyone. </span></p></body></html>
