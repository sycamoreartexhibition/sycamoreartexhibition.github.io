Hate crimes in general should be stopped. A hate crime is when someone who disagrees with &ldquo;another group&#39;s&rdquo; views, then the opposer does something, usually illegal, extremely wrong. An example of a hate crime was the Orlando shootings. The Orlando shootings were very impactful (</span><span class="c1">Solis, Steph, 2017). The LGBT+ community were the second most targeted group in 2005 (after the Jews), but in 2014 the LGBT+ were the most targeted group; 160 million confirmed hate crimes in 2005 when in 2015 about 150 million. The Jews with 200 million confirmed hate crimes in 120 million in 2014 (Mykhyalyshyn, Haeyoun Park and Iaryna, 2017).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The LGBTQQIAAP2S, which means Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, Pansexual, and 2Spirit, is a &ldquo;community&rdquo; of people who classify under the queer spectrum. Someone who classifies as gay or lesbian, is attracted to someone of the same sex. A bisexual is someone who is attracted to their same sex and the opposite sex. Transgender means that someone (man or woman) identifies emotionally and mentally of a gender that does not match their birth gender. Queer is an umbrella term that is all of the letters together. When someone identifies as questioning, it means they are currently unaware of their identity. Intersex is a condition in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit the &ldquo;typical definition&rdquo; of female or male. Someone who has no sexual preference only romantic is called Asexual. Ally is a word that describes someone who isn&rsquo;t queer but supports the community. Someone who identifies as Pansexual is attracted to someone no matter the gender, but is attracted to one&rsquo;s personality. 2Spirit is a native american term; someone who displays female and male qualities, whether in personality, sexuality, and/or gender identity. (Milligan, Kristy, 2017.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The LGBT+ community should not be treated differently than anyone else. Human beings should be treated like human beings. Many laws have changed for the LGBT+ community. In 1973 being gay was finally considered not a mental illness anymore. </span><span class="c2">The </span><span class="c2">American Psychiatric Association</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;voted 13&ndash;0 to remove </span><span class="c2">homosexuality</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;from its list of</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;disorders. </span><span class="c2">The resolution also urged an end to discrimination of laws discriminating against homosexuals.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">UC Davis, 2017.)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Then 42 years later gay marriage is legalized in America, 2015.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hate crimes are extremely wrong especially when the offender damages a big group of people. When the person thinks they are doing something right they are extremely incorrect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When harming big groups of people, (like the LGBT+ community) it causes serious impacts on those affected. One of the biggest problems is long-term mental health consequences. It causes major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Bullying harassment, and any other types of hatred need to come to an end. Coming </span><span class="c3">out</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;has been a lot easier for queer people because they feel safer now. Coming </span><span class="c3">out</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is when someone who identifies under the queer spectrum tells someone they are queer. People who classify as bisexual get lots of hate, because people think of them as not &ldquo;gay enough to be gay&rdquo; or, &nbsp;&ldquo; not straight enough to be straight&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">America is not the only country that has legalized gay marriage, nor was it the first. Netherlands (2005), Belgium (2003), Canada (2005), Spain (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Argentina (2010), Iceland(2010),Portugal (2010), Denmark (2012), Brazil (2013), England and Wales (2013), France (2013), New Zealand (2013), Uruguay (2013), Luxembourg (2014), Scotland (2014), Finland: (signed 2015, effective 2017). Hopefully more countries are on their way to legalizing gay marriage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hate crimes need to end, because it causes innocent people to be harmed, for really no reason. The history of this community is very important to see, so you know that what these people have gone through is very sad and needs to be recognized.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">&quot;Defining LGBTQ.&quot; </span><span class="c3 c8">YouTube</span><span class="c1">.
