It was hard to defend my side of the argument because I didn&#39;t really have evidence so they always proved me wrong. This pushed me to learn more about the topic and I found that both sides are very well developed. Many refugees have migrated to the United States over the past decade, and some of them became legal here but not all. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When immigrants come to the U.S. they come with visas or not and a majority of them overstay their visas. In 2015 there were about 45 million immigrants that came to the U.S. with visas, and by the end of the year in 2016 not all of them had left when the visas expired. In the end of 2015 there were about 416,500 undocumented immigrants still in the country. Some of the immigrants became legal but the in the U.S. but I took a while. On pewresearch.org it said,&rdquo;Under Pressure from congress to improve tracking of foreign visitors, the department of Homeland Security has produced its first partial estimate of those who overstay their permits to be in the U.S. Out of 45 million U.S. arrivals by air and sea whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal 2015, the agency estimates that about 416,500 people were still in the country in 2016.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crimes are made everyday in the U.S. either by a citizen or not. As immigrants enter this country they get legalized or they don&#39;t, but they do make crimes. Not all of the immigrants but a majority of them do. Not only do they commit the crimes but the U.S. police release them back into the public. If an undocumented immigrant commits a crime they should be deported back to their native-born country. The chairman Chaffetz released to the public that the I.C.E. have released over 86,000 criminal immigrants to the public in 2010-2015. Not only did these criminals just get released, but they went back and committed another crime that was worse than the first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The immigrants in the U.S. are less likely to end up in jail, even though they get released back on not the public. These undocumented immigrants try to avoid criminal actions most of the time. They try because most likely they would have a chance of getting deported. In 2010 there was only 1.6% of prisoners that were from the age of 19-39 and immigrants. Also that same year there were 3.3% native-born prisoners, and that percentage has been increasing over the past decade. The percentage for the immigrants has increased and decreased over the past 3 decades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These immigrants that are here are very important to the U.S. in the economic area. They come for work here in the U.S. and they work verity hard. In the farm fields these immigrants work all day and they have their work. These workers probably provide the fruits and vegetables that you eat. On voanews.com it says,&rdquo; As Americans have moved away from agriculture farm employers say they have come to rely on illegal immigrants to harvest the fresh fruits and vegetables on the nation&#39;s dinner table.&rdquo; The immigrants have been picking up the slack on the jobs that the Americans don&#39;t do anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also we rely on the immigrants so much that if the U.S. deported all of the undocumented immigrants, the United States Economy would crash. The United State&rsquo;s economy would go down $5 trillion over a decade. In other words we would lose 8 Million workers and mostly to farm workers. cbsnews.com states,&rdquo;Undocumented workers contribute about 3 percent of private-sector gross domestic product, or about $5 trillion over a decade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If immigrants were to get deported it would be tragic, but it would be tragic if they didn&#39;t. When immigrants migrate to the U.S. they come to start a new life or for work. Then once they get settled in for a while and get their life put together, their visas expired. Their old life not safe if they go back they could get killed. They thought that they could wait a while while their visas were renewed, and then everything would be okay. Then things go the opposite direction and they have to get deported back to their native-born country, where it&#39;s unsafe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also it&#39;s tragic if immigrants stay too. If an immigrant starts to hang out around you and you don&#39;t really trust this person because they have a background. Then this person starts to act suspicious and your uncomfortable. Finally they start to leave and not be around you anymore. You think you&#39;re okay because that person&#39;s gone, but then one day they commute a crime and you&#39;re the victim. This action could have hurt or killed you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immigrants are needed in the U.S. for big reasons. They pick food and hold up our economy. These people can also commit crimes that harm people. Either way if the immigrants are deported or not it could end up as a tragic story for their life. Maybe even someone else&#39;s life could end in a tragedy because of this immigration problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
