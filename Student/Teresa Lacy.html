White lives matter is a problem because they are a threat to our people and have taken over many people with their strong power of hate. Most of them are Neo-Nazi, anti-gay, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and Holocaust-denying. They only like people that are exactly like them.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Since white people used to slave black people, they learn their history and think that it&rsquo;s still okay to treat black people differently others. Some people also get racism from their parents and they get it from their parents and on and on. Most racism is not the person&rsquo;s fault, they just follow in others footsteps. They see black people as criminals and trouble that is why people treat them differently</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">They learn their morals and belief systems from their ancestors passed down from generation to generation. It is hard to break the cycle of their beliefs because they have learned these things since birth. For example all ignorant white people think that all mexicans are from Mexico and speak spanish, but there are some mexicans including myself that are not from Mexico and don&rsquo;t speak spanish. </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">My views are as followed, I think that everyone should be equally treated and seen the same because history should not and will not repeat itself. I don&#39;t believe that the way white people and white supremacist treat black people is right, so I would stand by the right side Here are some reasons why I would stand up for black people. First of all they have had a horrific past and are still being treated like their ancestors were. Second of all white people still harass them to this day, here are some examples. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Residents in New York were upset when they found that there were WLM fliers on their driveways. ( May.J, Pg.1, 2017) Some white supremacist followed a group of black men yelling racial slurs. (Edwards.B, Pg.1, 2016) White supremacist ruined a five year old&#39;s birthday party at a park by driving back and forth waving a confederate flag and yelling racist slurs.. (Barnett.R, Pg.1, 2015)</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Black lives matter is fighting for equality but White lives matter is fighting for superiority. If there was a period where everyone was treated equally and there weren&#39;t hateful groups of people, there would be less hate crimes and people wouldn&#39;t feel the need to be superior to others. If everyone was equal there could be a safer environment for people. Also everyone having equal opportunities would allow them to be successful in what they pursue. With equality come equity so not only will they be treated equally but they will be treated fairly..</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
