Security Council in 2003 that a little known terrorist by the name Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was the link between Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Baathist regime and Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s Al-Qaeda. This was to prove that iraq had terrorist connections, which called for preemptive strikes. Though this was later disproven, Powell&rsquo;s erroneous testimony would prove to be darkly prophetic. Global attention brought into the limelight a man who had previously dismissed as a petty thug, and who soon became the leading coordinator of terror networks in the Iraqi insurgency from between 2003 and 2006. This same man would in these three years sow the seeds for what would become the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). In this context, &quot;al-Sham&quot; refers to the historic region of syria &nbsp;and the Levan.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.iov5jxb1arhp"><span class="c5">Formation of isis </span></h1><h1 class="c10" id="h.1y3z10k19gqh"><span class="c5">Zarqawi had already formed links with Al-Qaeda when he was active in Afghanistan in the 1990s. He deplored Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s obsession with Westerners as the chief enemy, and considered the rulers of the Islamic world as the &lsquo;near enemy&rsquo; who should be dealt with first. Then he founded a jihadist group called Tawhid wal-Jihad in Iraq, which unleashed a reign of carnage and mayhem that escalated after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Despite their differences, the group formally became the Iraqi wing of Al-Qaeda. It was a marriage of convenience, in that Zarqawi&rsquo;s wal-Jihad received access to the resources of a formidable jihadist organization, while Al-Qaeda gained a foothold in Iraq, which was by now a global center for terrorsism.</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c16">The stated policy of Zarqawi&rsquo;s Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was to rally the Sunni majority into jihadist groups and target the Shia minority, a tactic ISIS employs to this very day. This gained criticism from Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s leaders, who feared that the indiscriminate terror tactics would alienate their supporters. However, Zarqawi continued his tactics until he was killed in an airstrike in 2006. In late 2006, AQI and eight other Islamist insurgency groups formed the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) without consulting Al-Qaeda. In so doing, ISIS ambitions were clear. It was no longer a jihadist group subordinate to Al-Qaeda, but an embryonic caliphate, governed by </span><span class="c2">Sharia</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;(Islamic) law, to which all Muslims in their territory owed </span><span class="c0">obedience. </span></p><h1 class="c10 c14" id="h.1y3z10k19gqh-4"><span class="c11"></span></h1></body></html>
