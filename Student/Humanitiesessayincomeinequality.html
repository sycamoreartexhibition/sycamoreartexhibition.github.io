The gap between the lowest percentile and the highest percentile is getting bigger and bigger because of income inequality.

On average, walmart workers get paid $8.00 an hour and the warehouse working conditions are so dangerous that 83% of all walmart warehouse suffer a job related injury or illness. Employees at the walmart warehouses have to work in 120 degree weather without any access to clean water, and this causes them to get bloody noses and throw up frequently. Lots of workers are often nauseous because the warehouses are fumigated often and they do not get aired out before their working hours so you can get sick to your stomach without a face mask. Emergency doors are blocked by trailers and supplies and everything is covered in a layer of soot. Most of the &nbsp;equipment in the warehouse is broken or dangerous so a lot of the workers have to lift boxes so heavy that if it were to fall on them, they could die. Lots of people who need the money enough to want to work 30 hours a week cannot because walmart does not want to pay the benefits of Obama Care- full time employees get half of their insurance paid by their employer and also half of their coverage except 9.56% of their household income. Even if they work 6 days a week, a lot of walmart employees get paid for 1 or 2 days less than they deserve. In protest, walmart workers signed a petition against the unfair treatment and pay, and they got a lot of signatures. When they presented it to the manager however, &ldquo;Some of us were immediately suspended, some of us were fired on sight,&rdquo; During one of the marches, a walmart manager drove a forklift straight into the line of protesters and said that anyone who continued walking would be fired. These Walmart employees are struggling to fight back because &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t speak up, or you&rsquo;ll be fired.&rdquo; (Limber Hernandez, walmart employee) These people need their jobs to have enough money. If they quit, they know they might not be able to find another job.(Hines and Wilkie 2012 </span><span class="c11">Walmart&rsquo;s Internal Compensation Documents Reveal Systematic Limit on Advancement, Miles 2014 Walmart Warehouse Workers Pilgrimage For 50 Miles Over 6 days To Protest Working Conditions, Jamieson 2015 Warehouse Workers Strike In California, Claiming Unsafe Conditions)</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this treatment of Walmart employees continues, and if the issue of income inequality continues to be a problem, there is going to be a revolution. When people get treated unfairly, they want it to stop. The lower percentiles are getting their income decreased every year, and they know its a problem. They&rsquo;re going to do whatever they can to get equal pay and treatment, and this will lead to mass destruction of our country.</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>People in poverty have a difficult time &ldquo;getting by&rdquo; or paying the bills. People at or below the poverty line earn an average of $2566.91 a month. To pay all of your bills including the cheapest apartment in Visalia, it is $1423.29.This doesn&rsquo;t include phone bills, wifi, cable, clothes, furniture,holiday seasons, doctor&rsquo;s visits, or anything else you might need.

This is the theory that if everyone, even the 95 percentile gets tax cuts, it will go back to the government in the long run. The argument behind this is the Laffer&#39;s curve. This is the theory that if people get tax cuts, they will spend more money at stores and businesses. That, in theory &nbsp;will lead to more employees, who now have even more money to spend. This economic growth would lead to a bigger tax base, which would eventually replace the governments lost money from the tax cuts, with a profit, which would help the citizens and their communities.(Amadeo 2017 What Is aTha Laffer Curve? Explanation)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The trickle down theory doesn&rsquo;t actually work. The laffer&rsquo;s curve is proven to only work if the tax rate is 50% or higher. The reason the taxes have to be in this &ldquo;prohibitive range&rdquo; is because if the taxes are at 50%, the taxpayers will have enough money to spend but if they are not, the whole theory fails and there is a huge economic downfall. The U.S. government hasn&rsquo;t taxed it&rsquo;s citizens 50% or higher since 1986 so this doesn&#39;t work. (Amadeo 2017 Why Trickle Down Economics Works In Theory But Not In Fact)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">During his presidency, Ronald Reagan cut taxes so the top tax rate &ldquo;fell from 70% (for those earning $108.00+) to 28% (for anyone with an income of 18,500+) the corporate tax rate was cut 46-40&rdquo; This is a big tax cut, which should follow the laffer&#39;s curve but instead income inequality worsened. The bottom 5 percentile annual income rose 6% which is good except the top 95 percentiles income rose 80 percent. During his presidency, the government&#39;s debt tripled.

The reason for this dethronement is that Czar ordered 11 million peasants to fight in the war. This was the final straw for the lower class. Even the soldiers turned on Czar, convinced by the Bolshevik party. The provisional government took Czar&rsquo;s place. This newly formed government consisted of bankers, lawyers, industrialists, and capitalists. This government chose to keep Russia in the war and were automatically opposed to by the soviets, which made the hunger for rebellion even stronger. The Bolshevik party started just taking land because the provisional government refused to divide it equally. The protests continued and the provisional government ordered for another huge war that led to mass destruction. This caused many people to join the Bolshevik party. Also, General Kornilov, the head of a major army was found trying to threaten people and gain power to become the new dictator of Russia. This led the Bolshevik party to have a lot more power and gain a lot more followers. The Bolshevik party later took over the central of Russia. Russia&rsquo;s new motto was &ldquo;All power to the soviets!&rdquo;. If people are being treated in a way they see un fit, they are going to fight back and do something about it.(Bunyan, James and H. H. Fisher 1934 The Bolshevik Revolution, Grey, Ian 1967 The First Fifty years)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The French revolution is more well known revolution, but the Bolshevik revolution and the French revolution are very similar to what is happening in the U.S. today.
