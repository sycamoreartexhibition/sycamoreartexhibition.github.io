Unfortunatly this injustice is ocurring to a religious group, Jehovah Witnesses in Russia. I am a Jehovah Witness and i feel that this is a serious issue because they have no reason to acuse these people of such charge of being criminals or extremist.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jehovah Witnesses base thier lives on the bible. And are known for being kind people who teach other people about god. They mean no harm to anyone, and as it says in the bible in (Matthew 22:39), &lsquo; you must love your neighbor as yourself&rsquo;. So we respect one another such as the goverment for example. We respect thier laws and them of course. And in this situation there is no reason to charge them because there is no proof of them being extremist or false. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How could this affect the people in this religion? They are banned from thier website, liturature, and even getting together to talk about thier faith, so how do they keep in touch? We dont know exactly but they have strong faith and continue to serve god anyway they can. Our response to the banning all over the world was the governing body in our orginization had a plan to make a worlwide &nbsp;letter writing campain from 8,000,000 Jehovah Witnesses . Which is basically sending hand written letters in our own language to the president of Russia. To testify and to give witness that &nbsp;we are not extremist or bad people.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The council of russia has no proof that we are extremist, because they would have shown it in court. Now that the last day they didnt lift charges there is the final day of court testimony, we dont know what day it will be, but it wont happen in a period of time, which will be a special day for us. Another thing about jehovah witnesses is they do not hold gruges against anyone, they dont even know where they went wrong. They now continue to press charges on innocent people who havent done anything. But brothers in the religion who live there communicate or at least try to keep their faith strong.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So this is an argument because they were accused falsely and they dont even have evidence to support their claim, so why do they hate them? There is no reason to hate. I consider this an important issue because no one wants to be accused for no reason, some witnesses are even in jail or prison already. This is a false acusation. The council determine to liquidate them anyway they can, but now we wait for the day they have the last trial.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All in all, they were wrong the president and the government. But we still continue to respect them but anything against gods laws we dont follow and they havent broke anything. So this argument got them nowhere cuase it was pointless but im not saying its not important. I</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;mean sure they have authority but isnt god higher?</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
