The unsuspecting &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is then promptly squashed (in extreme cases people have burned them and consequently burned down their house; see Exothermic Entomology Awards). Often, unbeknownst to the eradicator, these are beneficial insects that are wrongfully abhorred. With all these identification issues, it is important to know what an insect is. Scientifically, an insect is an invertebrate having six legs, antennae, and a head , thorax, and abdomen. An insect undergoes metamorphosis, whether complete or incomplete. Culturally(I mean many Western cultures, especially American), a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; refers to a small creature that crawls and should be killed. This is a general statement, but is true for the majority. The only time we seem to admire bugs is in literature and some movies, but even then they are given human qualities like being bipedal, eyes that blink, and less intimidating mouthparts. Other than that, and they are seemingly insignificant, mindless creatures with no regards but to reproduce, feed, and harm or annoy us in some way. They are easy to kill. We are oblivious of their importance and they are generally thought of as disgusting, except for a few fortunate favorites.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do we despise these useful bugs? The word &ldquo;disgust&rdquo; itself can be broken down to explain: The first part (dis) comes from &ldquo;des,&rdquo; meaning the opposite of&rdquo; and either &ldquo;gout&rdquo; (French) or perhaps &ldquo;gustus&rdquo; (Latin), which roughly means &ldquo;taste.&rdquo; However, taste is not the only factor in the emotion disgust. Jeffrey Lockwood helps illustrate the causes of disgust. In his article &ldquo;How to Cultivate Disgust, he explains. Something that is disgusting creates a strong aversion because of its potential to harm through proximity (&ldquo;Get me away from that bug!&rdquo;), contact (&ldquo;Ew, don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo;) or ingestion (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put that worm in your mouth!&rdquo;). Disgust is intimately connected to sensory experiences. Humans can remember times of other emotions such as fear, happiness, and anger, but not disgust. Only when we experience the actual object of disgust can we evoke disgust. So, in other words, only when you are actually seeing the actual spider crawl up your drain can you feel real disgust towards it. You can remember that you were disgusted and what disgusted you, but not feel the feeling. Disgust is designed to protect us from potentially harmful contaminants. For example, we wouldn&rsquo;t usually go rolling in a pile of feces because it arouses disgust. This is your brain&rsquo;s way of preventing you from a potential disease. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Despite the etymology of disgust, smell plays a more important role in disgust, as the only taste capable of creating true disgust is overwhelmingly excessive sweetness- a pinch of sugar is tasty, but a whole bowlful is disgusting (and bad for you). The human brain is wary of things that can infect or harm us.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">We are keenly attuned to the tactile properties of substances that are likely to infect us&mdash;curdled, gooey, lukewarm, moist, mucky, oily, scabby, slimy, slithery, and squishy. These are the textures of feces, mucus, lesions, innards, worms, snakes, cockroaches, and maggots.&rdquo; (Lockwood, 2013) Interestingly, disgust is not aroused by sight and sounds alone without associations with other senses whether it&rsquo;s our own imagination or memories, because this requires thought, as opposed to other senses, where we automatically are disgusted. Lockwood goes on to say, &ldquo;We are disgusted by what we think something is and where we believe it has been.&rdquo; If we believe something has touched something gross, then we see it as disgusting itself. When we see a fly land on our plate, whether consciously or not, we recall times of seeing flies on dead things or on feces. So we instantly assume it had just landed on something, for example, a carcass. In other words, feel like the presumed carcass fell onto our plate instead of the fly. We tend to assume the worst when it comes to contamination. In a way, this makes disgust pessimistic, just like American attitudes towards insects and other arthropods. We tend to pass this unhealthy hatred and disgust onto our children through our example.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A lot of this comes from general miseducation. There are an absolutely ridiculous amount of myths surrounding arthropods. Someone tells us something about bugs, and no one bothers to check if this is accurate. Many children are taught an aversion to insects and other &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; by their parents or schoolteachers. One study found that most children had more personal knowledge about the harmful effects of insects than the beneficial effects (Barrow, 2002). Never-ending cycles start where parents (and perhaps schoolteachers) show children that negative reactions to arthropods are not only acceptable, but are often encouraged. A toddler is told not to go near that spider because &ldquo;it will bite you,&rdquo; which, yes, toddlers usually don&rsquo;t know the difference between &ldquo;harmful ones&rdquo; and &ldquo;safe ones,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t teach them the truth, or we don&rsquo;t know the truth ourselves. Many are so uneducated about arthropods that they instantly assume that the less than one percent of actual pests are all there is, or that the term pest applies to all but butterflies because they are pretty. People sometimes don&rsquo;t even realize that the caterpillars they squash are the butterflies they love.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c10">In order for us to better appreciate bugs, we need to clear up common myths. These myths rise from misinformation. In fact, the very term &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is inaccurate. Bugs are actually a specific classification, </span><span class="c2 c4 c10">Hemiptera</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(&ldquo;half wing&rdquo;). These are the only true bugs, hence the name true bug order. Other insect misidentifications include crane flies, also known as mosquito hawks and many other names. Mosquito hawks, as we sometimes call them, do not eat mosquitoes. They eat nectar and other plant juices, therefore they do not suck blood, although they look like giant mosquitoes to some. Some people also think they sting, but that is the ovipositor, not a stinger, used for laying eggs. Speaking of eggs, earwigs do not lay eggs in your ears, and are just as likely as any other small insect/&rdquo;bug&rdquo; to crawl in your ear. The likelihood of that is almost nothing. Many are frightened by their pincers, which are used for self- defense. Also, bees, wasps, and their kin don&rsquo;t usually commit hate crimes against people. Usually they are just defending themselves, and will not attack unless provoked. The best way to deal with one of these that is getting uncomfortably close is to gently wave your hand in its direction, like you would a fly. Do not swat it, because you could hit the stinger and sting yourself. Also, mosquitoes only suck blood if they are a female who needs to lays eggs. They use the protein in the blood for their eggs. Other than that, and they feed on plant juices, like nectar, just like the males. There are numerous more myths and misconceptions, but for the sake of brevity, not all of them are being answered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Entomologists, on the other hand, could probably answer more. They are among the entomophilic. Some have a few jitters around one or two species, but for the most part love insects. Recently, on NPR news, an article discussed a hashtag entomologists have been doing lately (#FaceBug) to encourage people to relax about bugs. They put walkingsticks, tarantulas, and cicadas along with others on their faces. Joe Ballenger, who helps run Ask an Entomologist, said, &ldquo;putting the insect on your face answers two of those questions at once. How big is this thing in real life, ad will it hurt me?&rdquo; Not everyone appreciates insects like this, but insects have more value than we realize.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c10">Although insects as food is not always the most popular idea in the US, many parts of the world have insects on the menu. They are a useful source of protein. In fact, cricket flour has three times more protein than steak (draxe.com). Humans aren&rsquo;t the only ones eating insects, either. Insects play an important role in ecosystems, and feed those animals that are way more popular in Western Societies. Also, insects play an enormous role in pollination. Honeybees help pollinate roughly $20 billion in crops per year in America. In addition, beeswax (from bees) can be used as a base for ointments, polishes, and candlemaking. 40% of beeswax is used in cosmetic manufacture. Also, without insects, we wouldn&rsquo;t have silk. Silkworms in China produce 30,000 pounds of raw silk annually. Small insects called lac scale insects create 40 million pounds of lac in India every year. The Encyclopedia Smithsonian said, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c10">Lac is an important ingredient of many items, including floor polishes, shoe polishes, insulators, various sealants, printing inks, and varnish.&rdquo; Scale insects also produce dyes for various products. In addition, without fruit flies, we wouldn&rsquo;t have known nearly as much about genetics. Also, despite dermestids, or &ldquo;carpet beetles,&rdquo; being pests, they can be used for cleaning mammal skeletons in museums. In fact, museum curators intentionally </span><span class="c2 c4 c10">allow</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the dermestid colonies to thrive in the skeletons.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c10">As you can see, insects play an important role in society. They are not just something to kill. They are fascinating if you take the time to learn about them. Yes, some </span><span class="c2 c4 c10">can</span><span class="c2 c10">&nbsp;be infestations, but if you take advantage of the abundance of them, they can be a great way for your </span><span class="c1">children to learn about nature. By learning to appreciate nature, we can better conserve these marvelous creatures of the earth. If not, at least think twice before squashing that bug. I&rsquo;m sure it would appreciate a quick catch-and- release into the comforting wilds of your backyard.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5 c2">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Anupauma. &quot;Information and Uses of Lac (Laccifer Lacca).&quot; </span><span class="c2 c4">Bimbima</span><span class="c5 c2">.
